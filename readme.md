# Yaml Translation Viewer

This is a tiny app to take a Yaml text and generate easily copyable texts which otherwise requires a lot of selecting and de-tabbing to do if manually editing a yaml file.

Use this by opening: [https://ddikman.github.io/yaml-translation-viewer/](https://ddikman.github.io/yaml-translation-viewer/)
